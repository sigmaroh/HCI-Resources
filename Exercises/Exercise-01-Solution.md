Exercise 01 - Big Issues
For four out of the seven big issues mentioned in the lecture (and below), find an app from your own
smartphone that you use yourself and describe how this app addresses the respective issue. Please explain
your choice in a few sentences each, and add 1-2 explanatory screenshots where needed.
• Limited power supply
• Limited storage
• Wireless communication channels
• Limited/different I/O capabilities
• Unpredictable usage context
• Privacy & Security
• Sustainability


1. Limited Power Supply - Spotify
Spotify provides a data saver/low power mode that reduces streaming quality and turns off extra animations. This helps extend battery life when I listen to music on the go.

2. Limited Storage – Google Photos
Google Photos automatically backs up photos/videos to the cloud and has a “Free up space” option to remove local copies. This helps me manage limited storage on my phone.

3. Wireless Communication Channels – WhatsApp
WhatsApp adapts to different network strengths by compressing images and lowering video call quality on slow connections. This ensures communication works even with weak or unstable networks.

4. Limited/Different I/O Capabilities – Google Maps
Google Maps supports voice navigation and touch gestures instead of relying on traditional keyboard/mouse input. This makes it easy to use while walking or driving with limited input options It also provides offline data


5. Unpredictable Usage Context – Google Maps
Google Maps automatically adjusts to my location, movement, and time of day, suggesting routes for walking, driving, or public transport. This flexibility supports use in changing environments.


6. Privacy & Security – Mobile Banking App (e.g., Danske Bank Mobile)
My banking app uses biometric login (fingerprint/face ID) and two-factor authentication for protection. It also auto-logs out after inactivity to keep my financial data safe.
 MitID app does not allow users to take screenshots.


7. Sustainability – Too Good To Go
Too Good To Go connects users with restaurants and stores to save surplus food at reduced prices. This promotes sustainability by reducing food waste while also offering affordable meals.
